      "I choose this problem for two reasons, my desire to write a Navier-Stokes solver and to advanced a project set forth in my undergraduate fluids class. The problem I will be investigating is the effect of buffetting over an open cavity. Most people are familair with this problem from opening their cars sunroof on the highway and hearing that annoying sound. The goal of this project is to model the physics of that system by using a Navier-Stokes solver with acoustics to model cavity flow. The code will begin with a derivation and implementation of the Navier-Stokes solver to get that working before adding the acoustics after."
